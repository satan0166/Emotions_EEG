Model Training:
Experiment with a diverse range of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.
Explore cutting-edge deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to harness their potential for superior emotion classification.
Meticulously tune and optimize your models' hyperparameters to unlock peak performance.
Real-time Processing:
Integrate real-time processing capabilities into your application to unlock practical, real-world scenarios.
Visualization:
Gain deeper insights into your EEG data, processed results, and model predictions through informative visualizations that enhance your understanding and empower further refinement.
Setting Up Your Environment

Install Essential Libraries:
Employ the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the necessary libraries:

Bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib plotly mne
Use code with caution.

Important Note:
Exercise caution when working with this code. It's crucial to familiarize yourself with the code's functionality and potential limitations.

Preparing Your Data

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather your EEG data and meticulously preprocess it to ensure it's in a format compatible with the analysis pipeline.

This may involve steps like normalization, downsampling/upsampling, and handling missing values.
Training the Model:
Run the provided train_model.py script to train your chosen model on your prepared dataset.

Feel free to experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameter configurations to optimize the model's performance.
Streamlit App (Optional):
To test your model and visualize the predictions interactively, launch the Streamlit app using the following command:

Bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.

Important Note: Employ caution when using the Streamlit app. As with the entire codebase, it's vital to understand its functionality and potential limitations.
Project Structure

data: Houses your EEG data, typically in a CSV format (e.g., EEG_data.csv).
models: Stores the trained emotion recognition model (emotion_recognition_model.h5) alongside auxiliary files like the scaler (scaler.pkl) and label encoder (label_encoder.pkl) used during preprocessing.
app.py: Contains the code for the optional Streamlit app, if included.
train_model.py: Implements the training logic for the emotion recognition model.
requirements.txt: Lists the required libraries for project execution.
